The third_party directory serves as a centralized location for managing external dependencies, ensuring version control and maintaining compatibility across the project. This approach helps in:

1. Version stability and consistency
2. Custom modifications tracking
3. Dependency management
4. Better control over external code

Please ensure to review the respective subdirectories' documentation for specific usage and implementation details.
